### Navie Bayes Algorithm

#### Introduction

Navie Bayes algorithm is a classification method based on Bayess theorem and hypothesis of characteristic conditions. Bayes classifier assumes that the value of a particular feature is independent of the value of any other feature, given the class variable.

For a given training set, the joint probability distribution of input and output is learnt. Then, base on this model, the output *y* with the highest posterior probability is obtained by using Bayes' theorem for a given input *x*.
